It's just a game, but it is not fun to play. You will receive $80 to stay in this uncomfortable room, alone, with nothing to do. You are hungry. You don't want to eat food from the floor.<br /><br />You think about being outside again, talking to Jessie, perhaps making friends with Theresa and George. There are many better things to do than to play this stupid game.<br /><br />You knock on the door.<br /><br />The guards come: Jessie and George and the guard who shouted at you.<br /><br />You say: "Democracy has failed us."<br /><br />You are free.<br /><br />Theresa, Jeremy, Charlie and prisoner 613 don't look at you as you pass their cell.<br /><br /><br /><br /><hr>That's one possible ending.<br />Now you can <a href='1.html'>read the story again</a> and make different choices.
