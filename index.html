        <p>"Look at this! A new idea for our holiday! A way to have some fun and earn some money!"</p>
        <p>Jessie's finger is pointing at an advertisement in the local newspaper. Jessie is a true friend, with creative and unusual ideas. It always feels good to do new things with Jessie.</p>
        <p>The advertisement says:</p>
        <p class="doc">
          The University of Watermouth wants volunteers
          for a psychological study. Do our clothes, names
          and titles change the way we see other people?</p>
        <p class="doc">Are you available 24 hours a day for the week of
          10 - 16 August? If you are selected, you will
          receive $80 per day. Food, clothing and
          accommodation will be provided.</p>

        <p>At the university, there are many volunteers. Professor Zenigman explains the reason for the study.</p>
        <p>"In a prison, there are prisoners and guards. The prisoners wear one uniform and the guards wear a different uniform. The prisoners have numbers, not names. They must call the guards 'your honour'. Do good people become bad when they have no name? Do good people become bad when they have power?"</p>
        <p>The professor gives a document to each of the volunteers.</p>
        <p>"This is a personality test. Please answer the questions honestly."</p>
        <p>When everyone has finished writing, you all go to eat a meal together. You and Jessie enjoy talking to the other volunteers.</p>

        <p>Jessie laughs and says to him, "You are dressed in very smart clothes."</p>
        <p>Jeremy answers, "I want to make a good impression. I want to be selected."</p>
        <p>After the meal, the professor reads a list of names. You and Jessie and 8 others have been selected.</p>
        <p>Professor Zenigman says, "We will use a coin to decide who will be a prisoner and who will be a guard."</p>
        <p>You take a coin. You toss it.</p>

            <p>You meet Jessie and the other 3 prison guards at the university. You are all wearing uniforms that make you look smart and powerful. You stand tall. You recognize George, and you meet Ruth and Emerson.</p>
            <p>Professor Zenigman shows you the building which will be used as a prison. There are many different rooms. Some look like prison cells.</p>

            <p>"The prisoners know a secret. To win the game you must learn the secret. You must not hurt anyone. You must give them food and water. You must allow them to keep themselves clean. All your actions will be filmed."</p>

        <ul>
          <li>"We cannot hurt the prisoners, but we can make them afraid of us.</li>
          <li>We must feed them, but we can make the food taste bad.</li>

        <p>You understand the guards' plan. They want each prisoner to feel alone and small and worried. They want you to imagine your friend's pain. You cannot share their pain, and that creates a different kind of pain in your mind. They want to make you crazy with imagined pain, to make you tell the secret. </p>
        <p>Charlie is screaming. Charlie can tell the guards the secret and they will stop what they are doing. But Charlie is not the weak link in the chain.</p>
        <p>You and your friends must work together. You must stop imagining things. To help your friends, you must force yourself to forget them.</p>
        <p>You open a book. It's time to enjoy life.</p>

          <p>You come back to the cell to take away the plates.</p>
          <p>Prisoner 196 says to you, "You are kind. We want to tell <i>you</i> the secret. We wrote it together. Look..."</p>
          <p>She shows you the bucket that the prisoners use for the toilet.
          It is full. On the outside, they have scratched away the paint. You can read some letters:</p>
          <pre>I t <i>i  s</i> a <i>p i s  s</i> p o t <i>a n  d</i> i t <i>i  s</i> a <i>b i g </i>o n e</pre>
          <p>You call Professor Zenigman. "We have won!" you say.</p>
          <p>"No," says Professor Zenigman. "They despise you. Read it again."</p>

        <p>You choose Theresa, because she has calm eyes. You take her to a different room.</p>
        <p>"You care about your friends," you say to her. "You care about the people of this city. You have a secret. If you keep that secret, people will get hurt. You can make things right."</p>
        <p>"You are right," she says. "Professor Zenigman gave me an envelope with a secret inside it. But I did not open it. I cannot tell you the secret because I do not know it. I am innocent. Perhaps we are all innocent. Perhaps you are doing wrong to innocent people. You can make things right. You can let us go."</p>
