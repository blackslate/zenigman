You untie the blindfold. You see that you are in an empty room, with just a bucket and a bottle of water. There is a tiny window high up on the wall.<br /><br />The floor is made of concrete.<br /><br />Time passes.<br /><br /><br />You are hungry.<br /><br /><br /><br />Time passes.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Night comes.<br /><br />The room is black.<br /><br />It is hard to sleep on a hard floor.<br /><br />The door opens. The guard has food on a metal plate. He drops the food onto the floor. The plate is empty.<br /><br />"Give us the secret, and you can go."<br /><br />He spits on the floor. He goes out. The door closes. The lock turns.<br /><br />There is no light.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="31.html">If you decide to end the game, go to page 31.</a><br /><a href="39.html">If you decide to play your role well, go to page 39.</a>
