"This is a game," you think. "A game of cat and mouse. But I am not a mouse. I can wait. I can be like a cat."<br /><br />The night is long. In the darkness, you create bright images in your mind.<br /><br />You imagine that the game is over. You, Jeremy, Theresa, Charlie, and prisoner 613 are together in a good restaurant, laughing, telling each other how you all stayed strong.<br /><br />Days come and go.<br /><br />Sometimes there is food that you can eat.<br /><br />Sometimes your mind is crazy with wild thoughts.<br /><br />Then Professor Zenigman opens the door and says, "The game is over."<br /><br />"Have we won?" you ask.<br /><br />The light hurts.<br /><br /><br /><br /><hr>That's one possible ending.<br />Now you can <a href='1.html'>read the story again</a> and make different choices.
