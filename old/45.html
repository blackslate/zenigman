You choose Theresa, because she has calm eyes. You take her to a different room.<br /><br />"You care about your friends," you say to her. "You care about the people of this city. You have a secret. If you keep that secret, people will get hurt. You can make things right."<br /><br />"You are right," she says. "Professor Zenigman gave me an envelope with a secret inside it. But I did not open it. I cannot tell you the secret because I do not know it. I am innocent. Perhaps we are all innocent. Perhaps you are doing wrong to innocent people. You can make things right. You can let us go."<br /><br /><br /><br /><hr>That's one possible ending.<br />Now you can <a href='1.html'>read the story again</a> and make different choices.
